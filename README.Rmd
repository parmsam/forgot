The goal of forgot is to help you search for that one function you need in that one package. This package is based on functions from [Rd2roxygen](https://github.com/yihui/Rd2roxygen).

## Installation

You can install the development version of forgot like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("parmsam/forgot")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval = T, message = F}
library(forgot)
library(dplyr)
## basic example code
## create a forgot tibble that has the package function doc fields
functions_in_pkg <- forgot::forgot("stringr")
functions_in_pkg %>% 
  select(function_name, title, desc) %>%
  head()
```

```{r}
## search for a keyword of interest in the forgot tibble
forgot::forgot("stringr", keyword = "count")
```

```{r}
## or search for a keyword of interest on only specific fields
forgot::forgot("stringr", keyword = "count", selected = c("title", "desc"))
```

```{r eval= F}
## here's how you can get a reactable HTML table that you can search on
forgot::forgot("stringr", keyword = "count", selected = c("title", "desc"),
               interactive = T)
```
